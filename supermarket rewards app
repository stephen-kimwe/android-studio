A supermarket needs an Android app that can be used to reward customers.
any customer that spends more than kshs. 1000 on any four different items is shortlisted as a winner. 
The ID of the winning customer is displayed on the next activity with the word winner below it. 
To do this the app must read in the customer ID and the four items that have been bought, 
calculate the total and check if the total is over ksh. 1000. 
This promotion runs even when the supermarket is giving discounts.

Consider Mr Joseph whose customer ID is 343455. 
Mr Joseph has bought item1, item2, item3 and item4 
all of which are discounted at 10%, 12%, 15% and 20% respectively. 
write this program and use Mr. Joseph's information to test your program.
