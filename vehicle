Create a class called a vehicle
that has two attributes namely color and engine capacity,

distance_per_litre and fuel_cost_per_litre. 
Create a constructor for all the attributes in the Toyota class. 
Create a method in the Toyota class called Cost_of_Journey() 
that uses the attributes distance_per_litre and fuel_cost_per_litre 
to calculate the cost of a journey that is 450 km. 

Write another method called sellcar(). 
A white car which has an engine capacity of 2000cc
will sell for between Kshs 1m to Kshs 1.5m. 

If a car has any other color for the same engine capacity, 
it will sell for 20% more. 
For this program, all values must be read through a well-designed activity interface.
